Sync logic.

One-way mode (legacy `run_sync`): list remote, download files matching the
extension filter, skip files that already exist locally.

Two-way mode for book files (`plan`/`do_action`/`save_cache`): diff remote
tree, local folder, and a per-plugin cache to compute downloads, uploads,
and conflicts. Caller drives execution and conflict resolution; the cache
is updated after each successful action.

Progress mode (`plan_progress`): same machinery as two-way, but the indices
only contain `.sdr` sidecar files (reading position, bookmarks, highlights,
custom metadata, custom cover). Used by the close/suspend/resume/startup
event hooks in main.lua.

The cache lives at <settings_dir>/webdav_autosync_state.lua via LuaSettings,
keyed by relpath (file path under the download folder / under the server URL
base) -> { remote_etag, remote_mtime, local_mtime, local_size }. Book and
sidecar relpaths share the same table; their key spaces never collide.
