# WebDAV Auto Sync – KOReader Plugin

Sync files from a WebDAV server to your device. Optional credentials, configurable download folder, and either automatic sync on startup or manual sync on demand.

## Features

- **WebDAV connection** – Server URL with optional username/password (Basic auth).
- **Import from KOReader cloud storage** – If you already configured a WebDAV server under KOReader's built-in *Cloud storage* feature, pick it from KOReader's own picker (which also lets you choose a folder inside the server) and the URL and credentials are copied over automatically. The local download folder is always chosen separately.
- **Download folder** – Opens KOReader’s file explorer; navigate and long-press a folder to select it (no typing paths).
- **File extensions (optional)** – Sync only files with given extensions (e.g. `epub, pdf, txt`). Leave empty to sync all formats KOReader supports (EPUB, PDF, DjVu, XPS, CBT, CBZ, CB7, FB2, PDB, TXT, HTML, RTF, CHM, DOC, MOBI, ZIP, MD).
- **Auto sync triggers (granular, opt-in)** – Each automatic trigger is its own toggle, all grouped in the **Auto sync triggers** submenu and gated by a master switch:
  - *Enable auto sync* – master on/off. When off, the per-event toggles below are greyed out and don't fire (manual sync still works).
  - *Sync books on startup* / *Sync books on wake* – run book sync at KOReader startup and/or after the device wakes from sleep. File-manager context only.
  - *Sync reading progress on startup* / *on wake* / *on book close* – run progress sync at startup, on wake, and/or after closing a book. Startup and wake reconcile the whole library; the book-close trigger pushes only the just-closed book (one network request). All three surface conflicts via the per-file dialog as soon as they're detected.
  - *Auto sync cooldown* – minimum seconds between auto-triggered full reconciles (wake / startup). Manual syncs always run regardless. Default 300 s, range 0–1800 s. Set to 0 to disable.
  - *Close-trigger sync cooldown* – minimum seconds between two consecutive close-trigger syncs of the *same* book. Closing a *different* book always runs regardless. Default 30 s, range 0–600 s. Set to 0 to disable.
  - *Wake settle delay* – wait window after wake before auto-sync runs; filters brief system wakes (RTC alarms, hall-sensor twitches, framework housekeeping) so they don't burn the cooldown. Default 15 s, range 0–60 s. Set to 0 for inline (pre-1.7.8 behavior).
- **Manual sync** – Use **Sync books now** or **Sync reading progress now** from the menu at any time. Both actions are also exposed in the Dispatcher (`WebDAV sync books now`, `WebDAV sync reading progress now`), so you can bind them to a gesture, profile, or reader-top toolbar button. Manual entries bypass both the master and the per-event toggles.
- **Two-way book sync (optional)** – When enabled, book sync also uploads new or changed local files back to the server. Affects book sync only — reading-progress sync is always bidirectional. Uses a small state cache to detect what changed since the last sync, so re-runs only transfer files that actually moved. Conflicts (a file changed on both sides) surface as a per-file dialog as soon as they're detected, regardless of which trigger is running. Deletions are detected and confirmed with you before anything is removed -- see *Deletions* below.
- **Reading-progress sync** – When the relevant per-event toggles are on, the plugin keeps each book's `.sdr` sidecar (last reading position, bookmarks, highlights, custom metadata, custom cover) in sync across devices via the same WebDAV server. Requires KOReader's *Document → Metadata folder* to be set to *Book folder* (the default), since only that mode places sidecars next to books.
- **Live library refresh** – After a sync writes files locally, the file browser, history, and collections views redraw automatically. New books appear and reading-progress badges (percent finished, status) update without needing to navigate away and back. Works for both book sync and reading-progress sync.

**Reading the diagram:**

- The four entry points on the left are the only things that ever start a sync. There is **no** sync triggered by Suspend or by reading position changes.
- **Close** is cheap (one network request, scoped to the just-closed book) and has its own short cooldown. Closing book A then book B fires twice; closing book A then book A again within the cooldown is debounced.
- **Wake** and **Startup** share the auto sync cooldown — the catch-up moments when full library reconciles happen. If both *progress* and *books* toggles are on for that event, progress runs first and books chain after.
- **Wake has a settle delay before the sync runs** (default 15 s, *Wake settle delay*) to filter brief system wakes — RTC alarms, hall-sensor twitches, Wi-Fi housekeeping — that briefly resume the CPU without the user picking the device up. On Kindle the plugin reads the framework's wake classification at the end of the delay. Set the delay to 0 to run inline on wake. Startup, close, and manual triggers are not delayed.
- **Manual** triggers always run, always show full UI ("Syncing…" + summary at end), and reset the auto sync cooldown. They don't reset the close cooldown.
- **Auto triggers (close, wake, startup) are silent on success** — no "Syncing…" indicator, no success summary. A summary popup appears only on failure; conflict prompts and plan-level failures (server unreachable, auth rejected) always surface. When wake or startup runs both progress and book sync, the merged failure popup lists each on its own line.
- The two cooldowns are independent and persisted across KOReader restarts (in the plugin's state file): a close-triggered sync doesn't push back the next wake/startup, and vice versa. Defaults **300 s** (*Auto sync cooldown*) and **30 s** (*Close-trigger sync cooldown*); both accept 0 to disable.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo so the plugin folder is named `webdav-autosync.koplugin`.
2. Copy the whole `webdav-autosync.koplugin` folder into your KOReader plugins directory (e.g. `koreader/plugins/`).
3. Restart KOReader; the plugin appears in the main menu as **WebDAV Sync**.

## Usage

1. Open the main menu → **WebDAV Sync**.
2. **Set server URL** – Your WebDAV base URL (e.g. `https://example.com/webdav`). You can skip this step and use **Import from KOReader cloud storage** to copy the URL and credentials from a server you already configured under KOReader's built-in cloud storage; you'll be able to drill into a specific subfolder during the pick.
3. **Set credentials (optional)** – Username and password if the server requires auth.
4. **Choose download folder** – Opens the file browser; navigate to a folder and long-press it to select it as the download location.
5. **Set file extensions (optional)** – Comma- or space-separated list (e.g. `epub, pdf, txt`). Leave empty to sync all KOReader-supported formats.
6. **Two-way book sync (upload local changes)** – Turn on to also push local changes back to the server. The very first run after enabling silently establishes a baseline of files already present on both sides (no transfers, no conflicts). Subsequent runs upload anything new or modified locally and download anything new or modified remotely. Applies only to book sync — progress sync is always bidirectional.
7. **Auto sync triggers** – Open the submenu and:
   - Flip **Enable auto sync** on (master). The per-event toggles only take effect with the master on.
   - Toggle the events you want: **Sync books on startup**, **Sync books on wake**, **Sync reading progress on startup**, **Sync reading progress on wake**, **Sync reading progress on book close**. Each is independent; e.g. you can have only "on book close" on if you don't want library-wide reconciles.
   - **Auto sync cooldown** – minimum gap between auto-triggered full reconciles, i.e. wake / startup (default 300 s, 0 disables). Manual syncs always run regardless.
   - **Close-trigger sync cooldown** – minimum gap between two consecutive close-trigger syncs of the same book (default 30 s, 0 disables). Closing a *different* book always runs regardless.
8. **Sync books now** – Run a full book-file sync manually (lists all files on the server, downloads matching ones into the chosen folder; with two-way on, also uploads local changes).
9. **Sync reading progress now** – Reconcile `.sdr` sidecars on demand without waiting for an event trigger.
10. **Help** – Open an in-app reference of what each menu item does and how to set it up.

Sync downloads **all files** under the server URL recursively; subfolders are recreated under the download folder.

### Two-way sync details

- The same extension filter applies to uploads — only book files are pushed.
- A small state cache (`<settings_dir>/webdav_autosync_state.lua`) tracks per-file fingerprints so unchanged files are skipped on every run. Progress sync shares this same cache.
- **Conflicts** (a file changed on both sides since the last sync): you'll be asked per file to *Keep local (upload)*, *Keep remote (download)*, or *Skip*. The dialog appears for every trigger that detects a conflict — manual sync, startup, wake, and book close.
- **Deletions are confirmed, never silent**: when a file that the state cache knows about disappears from one side, the plugin asks what to do -- delete it on the other side too, or restore it from the side that still has it. Nothing is removed without that answer. Two guards suppress the prompt entirely when a whole side reads as empty while the cache is not (unmounted storage, an unreachable or wiped server), since that is a mount failure rather than a genuine mass delete.

### Reading-progress sync details

- Syncs every file inside any `<book>.sdr/` directory under the download folder — typically `metadata.<ext>.lua` (last reading position, bookmarks, highlights), plus `custom_metadata.lua` and any custom cover image.
- **Triggers**: see the [flow diagram](#how-auto-sync-triggers-work) for the full picture. Close fires scoped on the just-closed book (one PROPFIND, not a full walk); wake/startup do full library reconciles; manual entries bypass cooldowns and prompt to enable Wi-Fi if needed. There is no Suspend trigger — the close already pushed the just-edited book, so a full walk on suspend is redundant.
- **Sidecar location**: requires KOReader's *Document → Metadata folder* setting to be *Book folder* (the default). Other modes place sidecars outside the synced library tree, so they cannot be mapped to a remote path; the plugin silently skips them in that case.
- **Same WebDAV root** as book sync — no separate server or credentials.
- **Network**: silent triggers and auto interactive triggers no-op when offline (no Wi-Fi prompt during close/wake/startup). Manual sync prompts to enable Wi-Fi if needed.
- **Device-specific paths inside sidecars are normal.** A freshly downloaded `metadata.<ext>.lua` will still show the source device's `doc_path` and a `-- /…/metadata.<ext>.lua` header comment pointing at the source device's filesystem. KOReader rewrites both on the first open of the book on the destination device, so reading position, bookmarks, highlights, etc. all consume cleanly — the stale paths are cosmetic. The plugin deliberately does not edit sidecar contents in flight.

## Troubleshooting

Every log line emitted by the plugin starts with `webdav_autosync:`, so a single `grep webdav_autosync /path/to/koreader/crash.log` surfaces the full trail. By default you'll see info-level entries — trigger names (`trigger=close|resume|startup|manual_*`), sync start, and sync done with counts. Enable **Tools → More tools → Developer options → Enable debug logging** before reproducing to also capture per-file diff decisions, per-action HTTP outcomes, gating reasons (cooldown, toggle off, offline, brief unscheduled wake, etc.), and individual WebDAV requests.

If you suspect the wake trigger is being suppressed too aggressively, the relevant debug lines are `trigger=resume defer secs=15` (sync deferred), `trigger=resume cancelled reason=suspend` (device went back to sleep before the delay elapsed), and `trigger=resume skip reason=unscheduled-wake state=…` (Kindle: framework reported the wake was a brief system one). A real user wake will instead reach `trigger=resume progress=… books=…` after the 15 s delay.

## Requirements

- KOReader with LuaSocket (and HTTPS support for `https://` URLs).
- A WebDAV server that supports PROPFIND and GET.

## Files

- `_meta.lua` – Plugin manifest.
- `main.lua` – Entry point, menu, settings, auto/manual sync, lifecycle event handlers, conflict dialog.
- `webdav.lua` – WebDAV client (PROPFIND, GET, PUT, MKCOL; Basic auth).
- `sync.lua` – One-way book sync (`run_sync`), two-way book sync (`plan`), two-way progress sync (`plan_progress`), with shared `do_action` / `save_cache` and a single state cache.
